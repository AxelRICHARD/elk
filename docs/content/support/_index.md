There are lots of ways to get support. The following is a list you should probably work through from the top until your problem is solved.


## Documentation

The Documentation section has lots of information which may already provide answers to your problems.


## Forum

We have [a forum](http://eclipse.org/forums/eclipse.elk) available for you to ask questions.


## Reporting Bugs

Use our [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/eclipse/elk/issues) to report bugs you have found (or be told that what you've found is actually a feature). Please provide a reduced example that reproduces the bug to give us a chance to find out where things are going wrong.


## Mailing Lists

We have [a developer mailing list](https://dev.eclipse.org/mailman/listinfo/elk-dev) which we use to discuss development. Feel free to sign up to that list to keep track of what we're doing and to comment on plans we announce there.


## Contributing to the Project

We have [a whole section in our documentation]({{< relref "documentation/contributors.md" >}}) to help you get started!
